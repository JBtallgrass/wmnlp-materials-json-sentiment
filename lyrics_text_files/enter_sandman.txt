{'lyrics': "Say your prayers, little one\r\nDon't forget, my son, \nTo include everyone \nTuck you in, warm within \nKeep you free from sin \n\nTill the sandman he comes \n\n\n\nSleep with one eye open \n\nGripping your pillow tight \n\n\n\nExit: light \n\nEnter: night \n\nTake my hand \n\nWe're off to never-never land \n\n\n\nSomething's wrong, shut the light \n\nHeavy thoughts tonight \n\nAnd they aren't of Snow White \n\n\n\nDreams of war, dreams of liars \n\nDreams of dragon's fire \n\nAnd of things that will bite \n\n\n\nSleep with one eye open \n\nGripping your pillow tight \n\n\n\nExit: light \n\nEnter: night \n\nTake my hand \n\nWe're off to never-never land \n\n\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep \n\nPray the Lord my soul to keep \n\nIf I die before I wake \n\nPray the Lord my soul to take \n\n\n\nHush little baby, don't say a word \n\nAnd never mind that noise you heard \n\nIt's just the beasts under your bed \n\nIn your closet, in your head \n\n\n\nExit: light \n\nEnter: night \n\nGrain of sand \n\n\n\nExit: light \n\nEnter: night \n\nTake my hand \n\nWe're off to never-never land"}
