## Instructions 
### Task 1. Get Started
Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.  The base repository is available at: https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/json-sentimentLinks to an external site.
Clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.
 

### Task 2. Open Notebook and Complete Tasks 
On your machine, open the Jupyter Notebook for editing. 
Required: In your Markdown introduction, add a viewable, clickable link to your GitHub repo after your name. Build your brand and make your Markdown introduction clear and professional. 
Required: Use Markdown headings  (e.g. Question 1) to clearly show your content by each question number. 
Complete the first task.
Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
Complete the second task.
Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
Work this way until all tasks have been completed. 

### Task 3. Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
Execute each notebook.
After executing, export each notebook to HTML.
Commit and push your HTML files to your GitHub repo along with the executed notebooks. 
Verify you have a professional README.md that introduces your GitHub repository and provides helpful information about your project. 
Note: Your instructor may review just the notebooks - or just the HTML. Either way, notebooks are web pages, and we are learning to mine web pages. The more familiar you are with web pages, the easier it will be to get the information you need.
